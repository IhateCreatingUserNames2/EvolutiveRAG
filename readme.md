## Adaptive Memory Formation in Multi-Agent LLM Systems: Emergent Domain-Specific Concept Hierarchies for Self-Optimizing RAG

**Abstract**

Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on static, manually-curated knowledge bases that cannot adapt to changing problem domains or optimize their retrieval efficiency over time. We present the first demonstration of an adaptive memory system where Large Language Models (LLMs) autonomously develop domain-specific conceptual hierarchies through iterative problem-solving pressure. Our framework enables specialized agent collaboration to emerge naturally while building a self-optimizing knowledge base through vector-based concept formation.

**Methods:** We implemented a three-layer adaptive architecture: (1) three specialized LLM agents communicating through high-dimensional vector exchanges rather than natural language, (2) a criticality governor maintaining system stability through real-time parameter adjustment based on performance metrics, and (3) an unsupervised memory system identifying conceptual clusters through vector similarity. The system was trained on 7,200 mathematical problems across arithmetic, algebra, multi-step logic, recursion, and physics over 240 epochs, with increasing complexity creating natural selection pressure for efficient concept formation.

**Results:** The system autonomously developed 829 distinct conceptual clusters, exhibiting power-law distribution characteristic of natural language systemsâ€”the top 5 clusters consistently contained 23-24% of all memory vectors across epochs 100-240. Performance stratified by domain complexity: arithmetic (99.7%), algebra (97.8%), recursion (100%), multi-step logic (91.7%), and physics (72.1%), with the system allocating proportionally more conceptual resources to challenging domains. Notably, physics-related concepts dominated memory allocation: `concept_329` grew to 1,133 vectors (7% of total memory) specializing in analytical integration, while `concept_309` (771 vectors) focused on temporal kinematics. Agent collaboration evolved from initial imbalanced participation (65%/20%/15%) toward stable specialization (56%/25%/19%).

**Significance:** This work demonstrates the first successful implementation of adaptive memory in LLM systems, where conceptual representations evolve through communicative necessity rather than human engineering. The resulting system exhibits three key emergent properties: (1) automatic resource allocation proportional to domain difficulty, (2) natural consolidation following power-law distributions, and (3) stable collaborative specialization without explicit coordination mechanisms. Unlike static RAG systems, our approach retrieves concepts with quantified performance histories and domain-specific optimization.

**Impact:** These findings provide a practical framework for developing self-optimizing knowledge systems that adapt to their problem domains over time. The methodology is cost-effective ($2 USD for complete training), reproducible, and immediately applicable to commercial RAG implementations requiring domain adaptation. Our approach represents a methodological advancement toward adaptive AI systems that can autonomously develop specialized competencies while maintaining performance transparency.
