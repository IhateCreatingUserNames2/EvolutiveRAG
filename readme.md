## Evolutionary Memory Systems: Emergent Conceptual Consolidation in Multi-Agent LLM Communication Networks

**Abstract**

Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on static knowledge bases curated by humans, limiting their adaptability and efficiency. We present the first demonstration of an evolutionary memory system that develops specialized conceptual representations through communicative pressure between Large Language Models (LLMs). Our framework enables three specialized LLM agents to develop their own "language of thought" by solving mathematical problems of increasing complexity over 240 training epochs.

**Methods:** We implemented a three-layer architecture consisting of: (1) communicating agents that exchange high-dimensional vectors rather than natural language tokens, (2) a criticality governor that maintains the system at the "edge of coherence" through real-time parameter adjustment, and (3) a memory system that identifies emergent concepts through vector clustering. The system was trained on 7,200 mathematical tasks spanning arithmetic, algebra, logic, recursion, and physics, with complexity increasing over time to create genuine evolutionary pressure.

**Results:** The system developed 829 distinct concepts, with remarkable consolidation occurring naturally—the top 5 concepts contained 23.4% of all memory vectors. Performance varied by domain difficulty: arithmetic (99.7% success), algebra (97.8%), and physics (72.1%), demonstrating that the system automatically invested cognitive resources where most needed. Most significantly, concept specialization emerged without supervision: `concept_329` (1,133 vectors) specialized in advanced physics integration, `concept_309` (771 vectors) in temporal physics, and `concept_78` (688 vectors) in universal summation operations. Agent collaboration self-organized from initial dominance (65%/20%/15%) to balanced participation (56%/25%/19%).

**Significance:** This represents the first successful implementation of "Darwinian memory" in artificial intelligence—a system where knowledge representations evolve through communicative necessity rather than human curation. Unlike traditional RAG systems that retrieve static documents, our evolutionary RAG retrieves battle-tested concepts with quantified performance histories. The framework demonstrates three key principles: (1) specialization emerges naturally in proportion to problem difficulty, (2) conceptual consolidation occurs without external pressure, and (3) collaborative efficiency improves through self-organization. 

**Impact:** These findings establish a new paradigm for AI memory systems and provide the foundation for developing genuinely non-human forms of artificial cognition. The methodology is reproducible, cost-effective ($2 USD for complete training), and immediately applicable to commercial RAG applications. Our open-source implementation and dataset enable further research into emergent artificial languages and self-optimizing knowledge systems.
